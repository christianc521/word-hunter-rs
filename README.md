# About
Well, it's another find-words-in-matrix-from-dictionary-with-trie, but it's my first TUI application!
Some things to consider here are that it takes about 10-15 seconds to read the Word Hunt grid and type it into the terminal which is about a 15-20% time redution from the alloted playtime. After 4 games (my girlfriend is busy watching drag race), my best score was 12400; a new high from my previous PR of ~10000.
